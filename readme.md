This is my Weather App concept. The idea is that it fetches the weather from one API and displays a related image using the data from another.

### Installing
In order to run the app you must have the webpack-cli installed globally. After that run :

```
npm install
```
Once all the packages have been installed you can run the app using:

```
npm start
```
